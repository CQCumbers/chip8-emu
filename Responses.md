Tell us about the features and technologies you used in your Swift playground.

This was my first time using swift or writing an emulator, and I think swift playgrounds made the experience smooth and enjoyable. I especially appreciated the variable inspection features in swift playground, as it allows me to see the state of the RAM and registers in real time as the code is being executed. This made it easier to troubleshoot the emulator because I did not have to build a separate disassembler or debugger to get a good idea of what my emulator was doing. The switch/case range functionality also proved useful for parsing opcodes.

In what ways have you considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others?

I co-organized my high school’s first hackathon, which hosted over 60 participants from multiple schools in the area. At the event, I led workshops on Git, Electron, and other technologies, and mentored others working on projects like “night shift” for LED lights and a markov chain college essay generator. We specifically advertised the event to people who had little or no computer science experience and I think we were very successful in spreading our enthusiasm to our local community. I’ve also partnered with other students with less experience on CTFs like picoCTF and hackathons like Pennapps, where we've won top 30.
