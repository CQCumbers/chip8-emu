# Chip8 Emulator in Swift Playgrounds

I had ever implemented an emulator before, so I decided to make a Chip8 interpreter in Swift (which I had also not used before). I don't think this was a great idea, as preformance is not very good and things like UI took a lot longer than they needed to, but I do think I have a better understanding of CPU function, the Swift programming language, and implementing interfaces programmatically in UIKit, than I had before. The source code is also pretty comprehensively commented, I think, so perhaps it could be used as reference for future projects.
